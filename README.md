# Spotify_Rewind_-fun_project-

This is my own version of spotify wrapped



### About this project


Music has the power to evoke emotions, bring back memories, and shape daily experiences. This project leverages the Maven Spotify dataset to analyze streaming behavior and uncover insights into user engagement across different years, platforms, and listening habits.

<br/>

*The goal is to create a meaningful and immersive experience that allows me to reflect on my musical journey.*

Project Objectives
Create my own version of Spotify Wrapped using Maven Spotify Dataset.

Design
1. The Rewind Page – A Look Back

The Rewind Page is designed to help me reminisce about my top 10 tracks from each year. Rather than requiring me to manually select my data, this page is built to deliver an automatic and seamless playback experience, allowing me to relive cherished moments tied to my favorite songs.

Focus: All plays, including those less than 30 seconds.

2. The Overview Page – A Behavioral Snapshot
The Overview Page provides a high-level summary of my listening behavior, covering key aspects such as:

Listening platforms (iOS, Android, Web Player)
Shuffle and skip rates (understanding my song engagement levels)
Reasons for starting and ending tracks
Total streamed minutes (focusing only on plays lasting for 30 seconds or over)
This page helps me identify patterns in my music habits and understand how my engagement has evolved over time.

Focus: Streamed Plays (≥ 30 seconds tracks).

3. The Listening Hours Page – Platform-Based Listening Habits
This page answers questions like:

What time of day do I listen to music, and on which platform?
What are the top albums on each platform?
It allows me to see my hourly listening trends across different platforms and understand which albums dominate my playback on each device.

Focus: Streamed Plays (≥ 30 seconds tracks).

Notable Insights
1. Steady Growth in Streaming Activity
The number of streams increased over the years, showing a growing engagement with music. This indicates that my reliance on Spotify expanded over time, with a consistent rise in listening habits.

2. A Shuffler, not a Skipper
I prefer shuffling over skipping, suggesting that I enjoy exploring different tracks rather than frequently skipping songs. Additionally, my most common way to start and end songs is through "trackdone," meaning I complete most tracks rather than cutting them short.

3. 2017 was a Year of Quick Sampling for me
Among all the years analyzed, 2017 recorded the highest number of plays (2013–2024). However, over 50% of these plays lasted less than 30 seconds, meaning only 48% of the plays were fully streamed. This suggests that in 2017, I was more of a song sampler, frequently testing different tracks but engaging less deeply with them.

4. 2020 vs. 2021: Depth vs. Variety
2020 was my peak year for total streams, with 15,654 streams, 760 streamed artists, and 3,672 streamed songs—indicating deep engagement with familiar music.

2021, however, was my year of variety, with slightly fewer streams (15,282), but almost double the number of streamed artists (1,475) and more unique songs (4,723). This shift shows that in 2021, I embraced musical exploration, broadening my listening habits rather than sticking to a fixed playlist.

Conclusion

Working with the Maven Spotify Dataset was fun. It improved my knowledge of DAX (how to achieve transparent colors), and Power BI
